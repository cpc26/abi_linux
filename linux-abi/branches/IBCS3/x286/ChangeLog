	ibcs-3.7

	* Allow allocation of exactly 64Kb in "emu_brkctl"
	* Decommitioned TIMETRAVEL feature in favour of ABI_Y2K_BUG personality

	ibcs-3.6

	* Added (char *) memory checks, so nasty programs don't crash emulator
	* ELF version

	ibcs-2.2

	* Added the timetravel feature because most 286
	  xout binaries contain a broken libc calendar(Y2K).  
	* Fixed memory allocation in emu_memory.c  
	* Fixed lock handling for "pre-SysV V3.0 286" binaries.
	  This was obviously a bug in Xenix but there are binaries
	  relying on this bug. 

1998-07-18  David Bruce <David@Hulcote.com>

	ibcs-2.1

	Major modifications to x286emul.
	Fixed many bugs including:

	* Environment of program is corrupt.
	* brkctl() will not allow small model program to allocate
	  far segment and leaks memory.
	* Other system calls faulty, returning faulty data and
	  some corrupting the data/stack.

	Features added:

	* Working Signals!!!
	* Many new system calls.
	* Floating point emulation.
	* Small, medium, large and huge model programs all now work.
	* Emulator patches the program to use "int 0xef"
	  instead of "int 0x5" for system calls or if "NEW_SYSCALL"
	  is defined the program will call the emulator directly for
	  system calls so avoiding the trap into the operating system.
	* If you put a "%d" in the "X286DEBUG" environment variable
	  used as the file name to write debug information, the 
	  emulator will replace this with the process id. Also
	  the file descriptor is moved to a high number to get it
	  out of the way of nasty programs.
	* Reduced size of emulator by limiting the number of ldt
	  entries to 256. This is the Maximum for 286 Xenix.
	* Removed "in_emulator" variable and replaced with a check
	  of the code segment of the interrupted code.

	* Variable size stack for all programs.

	Known Problems:

	* Signals are not blocked during signal handlers. But then
	  this is the same as on 386 Xenix.

	* initial release of x286emul for Slackware 3.0
